PERESONAL Loan PredictioN based on Machine Learning 
I. INTRODUCTION
 	Distribution of the loans is the core business part of almost every banks. The main portion the bank’s assets is directly came from the profit earned from the loans distributed by the banks. The prime objective in banking environment is to invest their assets in safe hands where it is. Today many banks/financial companies approves loan after a regress process of verification and validation but still there is no surety whether the chosen applicant is the deserving right applicant out of all applicants. Through this system we can predict whether that particular applicant is safe or not and the whole process of validation of features is automated by machine learning technique. 
     

II. Data Set
 	The training data set is now supplied to machine learning model, on the basis of this data set the model is trained. Every new applicant details filled at the time of application form acts as a test data set. After the operation of testing, model predict whether the new applicant is a fit case for approval of the loan or not based upon the inference it conclude on the basis of the training data sets.
 	Loan Prediction Methodology :-

COLLECTION OF DATA SET
FEATURE SELECTION INFO GAIN OF FEATURES 
TRAIN MODEL ON TRAINING DATA SET 
TEST THE MODEL ON TESTING DATA SET 
RESULT ANALYSIS
	
Random Forest (RF):-

Random forests [8] are a group learning system for characterization (and relapse) that work by building a large number of Decision trees at preparing time and yielding the class that is the mode of the classes yield by individual trees.

CONCLUSION 
From a proper analysis of positive points and constraints on the component, it can be safely concluded that the product is a highly efficient component. This application is working properly and meeting to all Banker requirements. This component can be easily plugged in many other systems. There have been numbers cases of computer glitches, errors in content and most important weight of features is fixed in automated prediction system, So in the near future the so –called software could be made more secure, reliable and dynamic weight adjustment .In near future this module of prediction can be integrate with the module of automated processing system. the system is trained on old training dataset in future software can be made such that new testing date should also take part in training data after some fix time.
